## Summary on what is DevOps for me
In my opinion DevOps is the general model (some kind of a protocol/ideal rules/guidelines) of how software solutions for business should be implemented from the idea of planning, until its release date.
Moreover this model should have the following acpects : 
- flexibility (ability to be edited in any moment of time to be up to date to any changes in the development process/environment)
- process automation (using scripts and development tools DevOps engineer should  make software development process more stable and secure from any kind of mistakes/accidents caused by human factor)
- all acpects of SDLC should work in synergy and really fast (trying to use all available resources as efficiently / productively as possible)
